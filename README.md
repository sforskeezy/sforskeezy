# Hello, I'm Bryson Davis! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

Hello! My name is Bryson Davis, also known as **sforskeezy**. I am a Python and Java developer who fell in love with programming at the age of 13. With 9 years of experience, I've developed a deep passion for coding and enjoy every moment of it.

I mainly focus on Python and Java, but recently I have been trying to learn new languages and expand my skill set. For the past 2 months, I have been taking on commission work and find great satisfaction in delivering quality solutions to my clients. I am dedicated to meeting and exceeding customer expectations and am eager to take on new challenges.
